# Breach_Detection
This project is used to detect infiltrators and to detect suspicious activities in
high security demanding area. Security breach of restricted locations has become
a threat that everyone intends to eliminate.
Manual labor in security is faulty as it would have many human errors and other
factors like sleep, food, leisure, and shifts are involved, in addition to that a security
person cannot concentrate on all the areas at the same time and detecting an
infiltration is almost impossible. We intend to use image processing based on deep
learning (convolution neural networks) for image identification combined with
machine learning algorithms to analyze and detect a breach based on image,
height, thermals, and iris.
The project will be retrofitted with the existing security cameras and will also be
attached to a large-scale thermal camera to detect if a person is in an invisible area
like pip- lines or in a disguise, to second that it will also minimize and overcome
the effect of jammers. We can enhance our project to raise alarms when there is a
malfunction in some systems or if some suspicious activities are taking place.
Furthermore, this can also be used to locate terrorists from a group of locals and
send info to the base, thus enhancing our security furthermore to a great extent.
This project can also be implemented in other fields as well, like corporate
buildings, hospitals, malls etc., with various tuning
